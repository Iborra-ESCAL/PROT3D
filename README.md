The overarching objective of this repository is to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge regarding the various production phases and technologies implicated in the 3D design and prototyping process.

The objective of this research is to disseminate knowledge concerning the design of functional or industrial objects for reproduction in ceramic materials, and to develop prototypes and adapt them to processes that enable their serialisation or large-scale industrial production.

It is recommended that candidates possess fundamental competencies in computer programmes, image processing, vector drawing and basic 3D object modelling.
